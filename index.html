        <h1>Inner Join</h1>
        <div id="describe">
            INNER JOIN is a function that will return the intersection between tables using the condition we give to the function.
            <br />
            Below is the syntax for INNER JOIN:
            <br />
            <pre>
                SELECT &lt;column(s) name for new table&gt; <br />
                FROM &lt;table 1 name&gt; <br />
                INNER JOIN &lt;table 2 name&gt; <br />
                ON &lt;condition&gt; <br />
            </pre>
            We can find the intersection between 3 or more tables by using nested INNER JOIN:
            <br />
            <pre>
                SELECT &lt;column(s) name for new table&gt; <br />
                FROM (((&lt;table 1 name&gt; <br />
                INNER JOIN &lt;table 2 name&gt;) <br />
                INNER JOIN &lt;table 3 name&gt;) <br />
                INNER JOIN ...) <br />
                ON &lt;condition&gt; <br />
            </pre>
            We use INNER JOIN when we want to merge two data sets that are related to each other through a variable.
        </div>
        <div id="ex">
            For example, we have 2 tables, <b>Mealplan</b> and <b>Name</b>:
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>StudentID</th>
                        <th>MealPlan</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>000001</td>
                        <td>10 meals</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>000002</td>
                        <td>7 meals</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>000003</td>
                        <td>14 meals</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>StudentID</th>
                        <th>StudentName</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>000001</td>
                        <td>Andy</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>000002</td>
                        <td>Bob</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>000003</td>
                        <td>Charlie</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            and we use the INNER JOIN:
            <pre>
                SELECT Mealplan.MealPlan, Name.StudentName <br />
                FROM Mealplan <br />
                INNER JOIN Name<br />
                ON Mealplan.StudentID = Name.StudentID <br />
            </pre>
            and we will have this:
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>MealPlan</th>
                        <th>StudentName</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>10 meals</td>
                        <td>Andy</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>7 meals</td>
                        <td>Bob</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>14 meals</td>
                        <td>Charlie</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>

            <h3>What is a data scientist?</h3>
            First, a data scientist is a scientist. And scientist makes hypothesis, carry out experiments and then discover new things. Like chemist deals with chemicals, data scientist deals with data. 
            
            <h3>How do they do that?</h3>
            Data scientist are just human. They can't look at numbers and then come to some conclusion about a bunch of numbers. First they will gather all the data, and then use algorithms to integrate that data, or create visualizations to see the trend. To do this, they need a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, computer science,...
            
            <h3>Data scientist vs. Computer scientist</h3>
            A data scientist and a computer scientist have many things in common. They both have to know about algorithms and programming language. But while computer scientist answers the question <b>what</b> is the result, data scientist answers the question <b>why</b> is the result like this. Therefore, data scientists need more knowledge in algorithms and tools that are highly data-oriented such as machine learning or neural network.
            <br />
            For example, if we were to make an application, a game for instance, a data scientist would tell what should the game include to attract the most people through a lot of analysis, and a computer scientist would create that game.
